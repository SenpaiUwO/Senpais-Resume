            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>I'm not as much of a bookworm as I used to be as a kid, but I still love a good book, physical or digital, and if I'm reeled in I will gobble it up in a day or attempt too. I enjoy all kinds of genre's as long as the plot is tantalizing, and good writing and grammar is a bonus. Some stories I would highly reccomend are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery (The Full Series)</li>
                        <li>Jane Eyre by Charlotte BrontÃ«</li>
                        <li>Little Women by Louisa May Alcott (The Series)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>I love to write stories and help others improve in theirs. I've not finished any actual novels yet, but I have finished a couple short stories, and tons of poetry. If you would like a peek at some of my writing tidbits, click <a href="writing-tidbits.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Art</h2>
                <p>I used to love drawing as a kid, but now I've migrated to digital art and haven't really looked back since. I enjoy using the PowerPoint program to create my masterpieces, it has opened many doors for me that I never thought possible for myself. But with perserverance and much trial and error, I have built confidence in my art journey, and believe that I can achieve almost anything I set my mind too.
