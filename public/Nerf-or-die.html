        <p><strong>Nerf or DIE</strong></p>
            <p>Zerah sealed her eyes shut. The distant echoes of nuclear alarms scatter the tendrils of silence strangling her vocal cords, their mournful howls rippling through the smoke clogging her lungs. The noxious veil dimmed the skeletal remains of a city, mere fragments of a lost civilization. Crumbling walls and tattered vehicles littering broken streets, echoed untold stories.</p>
            
            <p>She struggled to inhale the remnant shards of oxygen engulfed by the smog, as the lips of death breathed into her nostrils the pungent breath of decay. It seemed as if her chest carried the weight of a million souls, a brutal reminder of everything she’d lost—of everything she had yet to lose.</p>
            
            <p>Her ears pricked at a sudden sound, sharper than the siren calls wailing across this sea of desolation—footsteps. Her heart crushed against her ribcage, she wasn’t alone. Resting a hand on the hilt of her gun, the stiffness in her muscles assuaged. Like a guardian angel, it always remained beside her, a companion without a soul to lose. A comfort in her darkest hour.</p>
            
            <p>She peeled back her lids, unsheathing viridescent orbs that darted across the fog, like  radars honing in on a target. Withdrawing her gun, she watched a dark figure emerge from the ashen swaddle.</p>
            
            <p>“Howdy. <i>Neighbor.</i>” The raspy voice of a man grated her ears.</p> 

            <p>Her blood curdled at his statement. She raised her weapon, the trigger burning her skin as the pad of her finger bled with sweat. She could sense a sinister aura slithering through the smoke, like a serpent it coiled around her, poised and ready to strike.</p> 

            <p>“What’s a frail thing like you doing in Outlaw territory?” A weathered face manifested to the glow of firelight as the man brought a lighter to the cigarette dangling from his lips. “Shouldn’t you be hanging with your kind?”</p> 

            <p>The blood receded from her knuckles as she crushed the hilt of her gun. Haggard phantoms devoured by the lips of erosion flashed across her mind. Starving skeletons with barely enough flesh to clothe their bones nodded at her through eyeless sockets.</p> 

            <p><i>Ash.</i></p> 

            <p>Her face contorted into a grimace. </p>

            <p><i>Icarus.</i></p>

            <p>The thunderous echoes of her heart dulled the restless cries of the alarms. </p>

            <p><i>Jaq.</i></p>

            <p>Her eyes blazed.</p>

            <p>“My <i>kind,</i>”-she spat-”are <i>dying</i> because of selfish bastards like <i>you.</i>” The whites of her eyes bulged from her skull as she harpooned him with a glare. </p>

            <p>“Is that so?” A low chuckle cascaded from his lips, slicing against her eardrums like the guttural whispers of a demon, as he withdrew a cobalt blue firearm. “Pray tell,”-he loaded a handful of brightly colored bullets into his gun-”how a <i>bastard</i> like me can be your savior.” Plucking the flaming cigarette from his lips, he crushed it beneath his fraying boot. “We’re both fighting the same battle kid, we share the same enemy.” </p>

            <p>“We are <i>not</i> fighting the same WAR!” A gutteral shriek ripped her throat, raw with grief, sickness, and <i>rage.</i> It bubbled within her fingertips, eroding her sanity as the trigger bit into her skin. A steady stream of colorful bullets sailed through the smoke, like aimless souls having lost their way. </p>

            <p>The man twisted through the smoke like a serpent, slipping between the bullets with effortless grace as he swatted them aside like flies. </p>

            <p>“You think I’m the problem? Heck, you don’t even know who’s pulling the strings.” </p>

            <p>“You’re all a bunch of blame shifters!” Her nails punctured her palm as she curled her hand into a fist—she recalled the stretchers bearing away the lifeless shells of those she’d loved, all because of a lack of necessities. “There is no justification for hoarding resources. You’re starving humanity because of your <i>selfish</i> greed!” </p>

            <p>“There’s a fine line between surviving, and greed.” His words ricocheted across the asphalt streets, slipping through the cracks of her crumbling soul as he inched forward. </p>

            <p>Zerah’s eyes ignited, their verdant blaze reminiscent of an aurora borealis cutting through the smog.The trigger became her voice, the bullets her words as they ripped from the throat of her gun with a shrieking bang.</p>

            <p>The man raised his gun, a smirk twisted his lips as he tipped his hat. Squeezing the trigger, he met Zerah’s bullets mid-air, igniting a rainfall of styrofoam darts that shattered her attack with deadly precision. </p>

            <p>Zerah watched as each of her bullets were laid to rest. Her heart felt as if it were in her throat as tears stabbed her eyes. </p>

            <p><i>Bang!</i></p>

            <p><i>Ash</i>. . . The first bullet embraced the dust, swallowed by the encroaching fog.  </p>

            <p><i>Bang!</i></p> 

            <p><i>Jaq</i>. . . The second bullet crashed to the asphalt, lifeless. </p>

            <p><i>Bang!</i></p> 

            <p><i>Icarus</i>. . . The echoes of war bled into a twisted symphony, the man's shots blending with the haunting chorus of voices that wrapped around her mind. </p>

            <p><i>You are our last hope.</i></p> 

            <p><i>We can’t survive much longer without food.</i></p>

            <p><i>Zerah, I think I’m dying. . .</i></p>

            <p>The world spun before her, a kaleidoscope of smoke, bullets, and ash. Her tearstained eyes widened as something kissed her temple. The chill of plastic grazed her skin—a gun pressed to her head. She hadn’t heard him approaching, he was a phantom of the night, the fog was his cloak, the shadows his refuge as he slipped through this bleak corpse of humanity—a spector. </p>

            <p>“Any last words?”</p> 

            <p>Her lips parted, but no words emerged as fear demanded her silence. Her gun slipped from her fingers, embracing the ground with a clatter. Her knees embraced the dust and she bowed her head in surrender, awaiting her inevitable fate. She clenched her teeth as the gun bit into her skin, she could feel the tip of the bullet grinding against her flesh. </p>

            <p><i>I’m sorry. . . I failed you all.</i></p>

            <p>Swallowing words imprisoned by silence, she prepared her vows for the reaper when a sudden light shattered the darkness. A large aircraft hovered, stretching over the desolation like a guardian. From an opening in its belly, a dome of light cascaded. A figure emerged, robed within the golden luminescence—a siren descending from the roiling waves of heaven, as a storm unfurled across the sea of clouds. </p>

            <p><i>Run!</i></p>

            <p>A voice whispered in the back of Zerah’s mind, but she paid no heed, entranced by the vision before her. </p>

            <p>A metal titan descended, shattering the earth beneath its weight. Shards of dust scattered before it, while the smog bowed in reverence. </p>

            <p>“By the gods.” The man's voice trembled. “A Sentient.” </p>

            <p>The Sentient bathed Zerah and the man in the unyielding glow of its single blood-red eye. </p>

            <p>“Humans detected.”</p> 

            <p>“Kid,” The man muttered, his voice deprived of the bravado that had stirred the embers of Zerah’s rage. “I know you hate me, but I need you to listen when I say this: <i>run!”</i></p>

            <p>Zerah’s face twisted into a grimace. “Why should I listen to you?” She seethed. “An <i>Outlaw</i> of ALL things.” </p>

            <p>Before he could respond, the asphalt cracked beneath a sudden violent impact, as something crashed down between them, scattering shockwaves through the debris. </p>

            <p>Zerah shrieked as she was hurled into a battered vehicle, the cold metal bit into her skin. She curled into a fetal position, her limbs inflamed with pain. Blood pooled into her mouth from where her tooth had punctured her lip, as her cheek had smashed into the door. Her chest heaved with coughs as she vomited the crimson liquid onto the ground. </p>

            <p>Raising her bloodshot eyes to the source of the impact, she beheld a massive cylindrical object—no—a bullet that had become lodged within the shattered asphalt. </p>

            <p>“Pathetic humans.” The Sentient's detached, metallic voice rumbled through the air, chilling Zerah to her core. </p>

            <p>Zerah’s heart crushed her ribs as she struggled to push herself upright. Her soul shriveled beneath the blood red glow of the Sentient's gaze. The machine's towering form seemed to swallow the atmosphere as its shadow engulfed the debris. Like a blade its voice sliced through the smoke, cold, calculating, devoid of emotion. </p>

            <p>“That was but a taste of my power.” </p>

            <p>“If you wish to keep your wretched lives,” It continued, “you must prove your worth.” Extending a metallic arm, a shower of colorful darts clattered to the ground before Zerah. </p>

            <p>“The battlefield has been chosen. Defeat me in a Nerf war, and live. Lose, and you will face immediate execution.”</p>

            <p>Zerah’s eyes flickered between the Sentient and the cluster of darts before her. In her peripheral vision, she could see the Outlaw staggering to his feet, he held a hand over what she assumed were his broken ribs. A strained laugh cascaded from his lips as he choked back pain, buckling beneath the weight of madness that seduced him to the allure of insanity. </p>

            <p>“See kid.” He rasped mockingly. “I told you we both share an enemy.”  </p>

            <p>“To hell with it.” Her eyes flashed. “You're <i>both</i> my enemies.” </p>

            <p>Scooping up a handful of darts, she scanned the debris for her gun, using the light of the Sentient as her guide. Its glow rippled over the carnage like  a beacon, paving a path through the darkness. The irony. A servant of Destruction providing a false sense of hope—the sight of her gun eased the rapid pulsations of her heart. It wasn't until the cold plastic was back in her palm, that her future didn't seem so bleak. It was as if the souls of her brothers were infused within its frame. A sense of comfort in this twisted world. </p>

            <p><i>Ash. “I believe in you Zerah. You're like a phoenix, rising from the ashes of your predicaments. You never stay down.”</i></p>

            <p>She steadied her trembling fingers as she slipped a dart into the chamber of her gun. Like a flame, his words burned brightly against the encroaching darkness seeking to devour her soul. </p>

            <p><i>Icarus. “You would carry away a piece of the sun just to keep us warm.”</i></p>

            <p>She jammed another one into place. She could practically feel the embrace of his words as they wrapped about her. She couldn't let him down. </p>

            <p><i>Jaq. “Never stop fighting for what you believe in.”</i></p>

            <p>With a fully loaded gun, she held her head high. Her blood stained lips curled into a smile as she met the empty orb of the Sentient with a gaze just as cold and soulless. This forsaken world offered no mercy, only chaos, greed, and carnage. But she had her gun, her brothers, and her resolve. </p>

            <p>“It's nerf or nothing,” she drew her shoulders back. “And I'm ready to unleash hell.” </p>
